        <h2>Javascript: the language of the web</h2>
        <p>JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles. Read more about JavaScript.</p>
        <p>This language is so popular because nearly every web browser can run JavaScript, making it a core technology of web development.</p>
        <h2>Javascript Versions</h2>
        <p>JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995, and became an ECMA standard in 1997. ECMAScript is the official name of the language.</p>
        <p>ECMAScript versions have been abbreviated to ES1, ES2, ES3, ES5, and ES6. Since 2016 new versions are named by year (ECMAScript 2016 / 2017 / 2018).</p>
