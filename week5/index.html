        <h1>Week 5 Notes</h1>
        <p>Topic of the week: error handling!</p>
        <h2>Errors, Exceptions, and Warnings</h2>
        <p>Errors are caused when something goes wrong in a program. They are usually caused by one of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>System error ― there's a problem with the system or external devices with which the program is interacting.</li>
            <li>Programmer error ― the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it could even be as simple as a typo.</li>
            <li>User error ― the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is unable to handle.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Exceptions</h3>
        <p>An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to deal with the error. For example, trying to call a method that is nonexistent will result in a reference error that raises an exception.</p>
        <h3>Stack Traces</h3>
        <p>An exception will also produce a stack trace. This is a sequence of functions or method calls that lead to the point where the error occurred. It's often not just a single function or method call that causes an error. A stack trace will work backwards from the point at which the error occurred to identify the original function or method that started the sequence.</p>
        <h3>Warnings</h3>
        <p>A warning can occur if there's an error in the code that isn't enough to cause the program to crash. This means the program will continue to run after a warning. This might sound good, but it can be problematic, since the issue that produced the warning may cause the program to continue running incorrectly.</p>
