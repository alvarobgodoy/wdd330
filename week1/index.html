        <h1>Week 1 Notes</h1>
        <h3>How to Rewire Your Brain for Mobile First UX</h3>
        <p>Devices come in very different forms, we have to adapt websites to display correctly on all of them.</p>
        <p>MOBILE FIRST!</p>
        <h3>How to Improve UX by Understanding Users</h3>
        <p>Find ways to fill your user's needs as simply as possible. A lot of times, people don't know what they want until you show it to them.</p>
        <p>Three important thing to keep in mind:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>IMMEDIATE: Be there.</li>
            <li>RELEVANT: Be useful.</li>
            <li>FRICTIONLESS: Be quick.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Better Mobile UX with Strategic Menu Design</h3>
        <p>Primary controls! We have to make controls be intuitive and easy to reach. By putting the controls at the bottom on mobile, we improve reachability and conversion rates.</p>
        <h3>Designing Intuitive and Mobile Friendly Forms</h3>
        <p>Just ask the right information! Don't put unnecesary inputs, like job title when you're trying to make your user sign for a newsletter.</p>
        <p>Another important thing with forms is to follow the standars when building them, this allow proper autocompletion, correct input types (also helps user see the right keyboard on mobile), etc.</p>
        <h3>Designing a Better Mobile Advertising User Experience</h3>
        <p>Users come to your website for content, give them what they want. We have to be really careful when placing ads, specially on mobile.</p>
        <p>And remember: stop using pop-us!</p>
